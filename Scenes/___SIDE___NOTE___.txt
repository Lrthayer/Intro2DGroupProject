The world scene and the shop scene will alternate within:
	
	("World" is just a place holder scene for all the levels for now. Later it won't exist, rather, Level01, Level02, etc...)

 -> Make 3 different level scenes: LVL1,LVL2,LVL3, 1 upgrade scene: Shop, and 1 end of game scene: GameOver

 -> levels will alternate like so:
       LVL1
	Shop
       LVL2
	Shop
       LVL3
	GameOver (can be win or lose)
    ....for now

Thw world interface will control general elements common to most all scenes.
